**Machine Learning Models**
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models, along with the necessary datasets and scripts for training, evaluating, and testing them.
Installation
To use the code in this repository, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Abdul-Rahman-Git/Machine_Learning_Models.git
   cd Machine_Learning_Models

2. Install the required dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

   
**Usage**
After installing the required dependencies, you can start training a model by running any of the scripts corresponding to a specific model.
For example:

```bash
python train_model.py --model <model_name> --dataset <dataset_path>
```

Replace `<model_name>` with the machine learning model you want to use (e.g., `decision_tree`, `random_forest`, `svm`, etc.), and `<dataset_path>` with the path to your dataset.

Example:
```bash
python train_model.py --model random_forest --dataset data/sample.csv
```
